### How it works

This app draws the most recent pets from the Petfinder API and filters them based on your location and the animal type you're interested in adopting. 

You can add the pet to your favorites and remove the pet as needed. You can change your location to see pets from around the country.

Uses React, Express, MongoDB, and Google Firebase.
